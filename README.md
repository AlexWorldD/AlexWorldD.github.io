## FINAL project for DataVis course at ITMO University, Winter '17 :rocket:
### [SpaceVK](https://alexworldd.github.io/FinalProject/)

The main idea is analysing the set of groups about Space: such as typical views/likes, and more rare gender/regions. What could help to find out some patterns of interest in outer space based on the users behaviou. For instance, the regions with a vast amount of people who are keen on outer space. The core of visualisation is line chart with days as xAxis, and selected statistics as value. Moreover, the line chart is interactive - hover event with current day and values. The second part of the vis is a map of Russia, where color of regions is filled based on the max value of views from this region from groups.

A lot of work-hours had been required by data munging and their adaptation for usage in js. Python scripts you can find in /py folder, raw data (Excel docs ) - in /data folder.
